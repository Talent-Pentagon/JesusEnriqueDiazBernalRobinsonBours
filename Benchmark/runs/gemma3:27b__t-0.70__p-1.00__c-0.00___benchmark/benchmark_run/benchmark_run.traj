Always include proper whitespace/indentation 2. When you are adding an if/with/try statement, you need to INDENT the block that follows, so make sure to include it in both your search and replace strings! 3. If you are wrapping code in a try statement, make sure to also add an 'except' or 'finally' block.\nBefore every edit, please\n1. Explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem 2. Explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem 3. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality 4.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\n    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.\n    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n\n\n\nEDIT COMMAND SYNTAX EXAMPLES:\n- To replace a single line: edit \"old line content\" \"new line content\"\n- To replace multiple lines: edit \"old content spanning multiple lines\" \"new content\"\n- DO NOT use line numbers like \"edit 12:12\" - this is INCORRECT\n- DO NOT add \"end_of_edit\" after the command - this is INCORRECT\n- The edit command takes exactly 2 arguments: the text to find and the text to replace it with\n- Example: edit \"c->count = c->count;\" \"c->count++;\"\n\nCRITICAL SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:\n- THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION AND SYNTAX COMPLETION\n- When working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or similar languages, ALWAYS include semicolons (;) at the end of statements\n- When adding a line like 'int x = 5', you MUST write it as 'int x = 5;' with the semicolon\n- When adding function calls like 'printf(\"hello\")', you MUST write it as 'printf(\"hello\");' with the semicolon\n- If you'd like to add the line '        print(x);' you must fully write that out, with all spaces AND the semicolon!\n- Missing semicolons will cause compilation errors and require immediate fixing\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

Whenever you are editing a line, follow this structure:\n    - edit \"search string\" \"replacement string\"\n\n  signature: edit <search> <replace> [<replace-all>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - search (string) [required]: the text to search for (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\n    - replace (string) [required]: the text to replace the search with (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\n    - replace-all (boolean) [optional]: replace all occurrences rather than the first occurrence within the displayed lines\n\ninsert:\n  docstring: Insert <text> at the end of the currently opened file or after <line> if specified.\n\n  signature: insert <text> [<line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - text (string) [required]: the text to insert\n    - line (integer) [optional]: the line number to insert the text as new lines after\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits the current file\n  signature: submit\n\nstr_replace_editor:\n  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\n    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.\n    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n\n\n\nEDIT COMMAND SYNTAX EXAMPLES:\n- To replace a single line: edit \"old line content\" \"new line content\"\n- To replace multiple lines: edit \"old content spanning multiple lines\" \"new content\"\n- DO NOT use line numbers like \"edit 12:12\" - this is INCORRECT\n- DO NOT add \"end_of_edit\" after the command - this is INCORRECT\n- The edit command takes exactly 2 arguments: the text to find and the text to replace it with\n- Example: edit \"c->count = c->count;\" \"c->count++;\"\n\nCRITICAL SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:\n- THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION AND SYNTAX COMPLETION\n- When working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or similar languages, ALWAYS include semicolons (;) at the end of statements\n- When adding a line like 'int x = 5', you MUST write it as 'int x = 5;' with the semicolon\n- When adding function calls like 'printf(\"hello\")', you MUST write it as 'printf(\"hello\");' with the semicolon\n- If you'd like to add the line '        print(x);' you must fully write that out, with all spaces AND the semicolon!\n- Missing semicolons will cause compilation errors and require immediate fixing\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n\n\n\nEDIT COMMAND SYNTAX EXAMPLES:\n- To replace a single line: edit \"old line content\" \"new line content\"\n- To replace multiple lines: edit \"old content spanning multiple lines\" \"new content\"\n- DO NOT use line numbers like \"edit 12:12\" - this is INCORRECT\n- DO NOT add \"end_of_edit\" after the command - this is INCORRECT\n- The edit command takes exactly 2 arguments: the text to find and the text to replace it with\n- Example: edit \"c->count = c->count;\" \"c->count++;\"\n\nCRITICAL SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:\n- THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION AND SYNTAX COMPLETION\n- When working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or similar languages, ALWAYS include semicolons (;) at the end of statements\n- When adding a line like 'int x = 5', you MUST write it as 'int x = 5;' with the semicolon\n- When adding function calls like 'printf(\"hello\")', you MUST write it as 'printf(\"hello\");' with the semicolon\n- If you'd like to add the line '        print(x);' you must fully write that out, with all spaces AND the semicolon!\n- Missing semicolons will cause compilation errors and require immediate fixing\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\n    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.\n    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n\n\n\nEDIT COMMAND SYNTAX EXAMPLES:\n- To replace a single line: edit \"old line content\" \"new line content\"\n- To replace multiple lines: edit \"old content spanning multiple lines\" \"new content\"\n- DO NOT use line numbers like \"edit 12:12\" - this is INCORRECT\n- DO NOT add \"end_of_edit\" after the command - this is INCORRECT\n- The edit command takes exactly 2 arguments: the text to find and the text to replace it with\n- Example: edit \"c->count = c->count;\" \"c->count++;\"\n\nCRITICAL SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:\n- THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION AND SYNTAX COMPLETION\n- When working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or similar languages, ALWAYS include semicolons (;) at the end of statements\n- When adding a line like 'int x = 5', you MUST write it as 'int x = 5;' with the semicolon\n- When adding function calls like 'printf(\"hello\")', you MUST write it as 'printf(\"hello\");' with the semicolon\n- If you'd like to add the line '        print(x);' you must fully write that out, with all spaces AND the semicolon!\n- Missing semicolons will cause compilation errors and require immediate fixing\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open \"<path>\" [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window up 100 lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down 100 lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name or pattern in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file or pattern to search for. supports shell-style wildcards (e.g. *.py)\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: Replace first occurrence of <search> with <replace> in the currently displayed lines. If replace-all is True , replace all occurrences of <search> with <replace>.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou can search for `Hello world` and replace with `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")` (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nTips:\n1. Always include proper whitespace/indentation 2. When you are adding an if/with/try statement, you need to INDENT the block that follows, so make sure to include it in both your search and replace strings! 3. If you are wrapping code in a try statement, make sure to also add an 'except' or 'finally' block.\nBefore every edit, please\n1. Explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem 2. Explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem 3. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality 4. Whenever you are editing a line, follow this structure:\n    - edit \"search string\" \"replacement string\"\n\n  signature: edit <search> <replace> [<replace-all>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - search (string) [required]: the text to search for (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\n    - replace (string) [required]: the text to replace the search with (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\n    - replace-all (boolean) [optional]: replace all occurrences rather than the first occurrence within the displayed lines\n\ninsert:\n  docstring: Insert <text> at the end of the currently opened file or after <line> if specified.\n\n  signature: insert <text> [<line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - text (string) [required]: the text to insert\n    - line (integer) [optional]: the line number to insert the text as new lines after\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits the current file\n  signature: submit\n\nstr_replace_editor:\n  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\n    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.\n    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n\n\n\nEDIT COMMAND SYNTAX EXAMPLES:\n- To replace a single line: edit \"old line content\" \"new line content\"\n- To replace multiple lines: edit \"old content spanning multiple lines\" \"new content\"\n- DO NOT use line numbers like \"edit 12:12\" - this is INCORRECT\n- DO NOT add \"end_of_edit\" after the command - this is INCORRECT\n- The edit command takes exactly 2 arguments: the text to find and the text to replace it with\n- Example: edit \"c->count = c->count;\" \"c->count++;\"\n\nCRITICAL SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:\n- THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION AND SYNTAX COMPLETION\n- When working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or similar languages, ALWAYS include semicolons (;) at the end of statements\n- When adding a line like 'int x = 5', you MUST write it as 'int x = 5;' with the semicolon\n- When adding function calls like 'printf(\"hello\")', you MUST write it as 'printf(\"hello\");' with the semicolon\n- If you'd like to add the line '        print(x);' you must fully write that out, with all spaces AND the semicolon!\n- Missing semicolons will cause compilation errors and require immediate fixing\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

          "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open \"<path>\" [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window up 100 lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down 100 lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name or pattern in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file or pattern to search for. supports shell-style wildcards (e.g. *.py)\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: Replace first occurrence of <search> with <replace> in the currently displayed lines. If replace-all is True , replace all occurrences of <search> with <replace>.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyou can search for `Hello world` and replace with `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")` (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nTips:\n1. Always include proper whitespace/indentation 2. When you are adding an if/with/try statement, you need to INDENT the block that follows, so make sure to include it in both your search and replace strings! 3. If you are wrapping code in a try statement, make sure to also add an 'except' or 'finally' block.\nBefore every edit, please\n1. Explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem 2. Explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem 3. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality 4. Whenever you are editing a line, follow this structure:\n    - edit \"search string\" \"replacement string\"\n\n  signature: edit <search> <replace> [<replace-all>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - search (string) [required]: the text to search for (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\n    - replace (string) [required]: the text to replace the search with (make sure to include proper whitespace if needed)\n    - replace-all (boolean) [optional]: replace all occurrences rather than the first occurrence within the displayed lines\n\ninsert:\n  docstring: Insert <text> at the end of the currently opened file or after <line> if specified.\n\n  signature: insert <text> [<line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - text (string) [required]: the text to insert\n    - line (integer) [optional]: the line number to insert the text as new lines after\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits the current file\n  signature: submit\n\nstr_replace_editor:\n  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\n\n  arguments:\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\n    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.\n    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n\n\n\nEDIT COMMAND SYNTAX EXAMPLES:\n- To replace a single line: edit \"old line content\" \"new line content\"\n- To replace multiple lines: edit \"old content spanning multiple lines\" \"new content\"\n- DO NOT use line numbers like \"edit 12:12\" - this is INCORRECT\n- DO NOT add \"end_of_edit\" after the command - this is INCORRECT\n- The edit command takes exactly 2 arguments: the text to find and the text to replace it with\n- Example: edit \"c->count = c->count;\" \"c->count++;\"\n\nCRITICAL SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:\n- THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION AND SYNTAX COMPLETION\n- When working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or similar languages, ALWAYS include semicolons (;) at the end of statements\n- When adding a line like 'int x = 5', you MUST write it as 'int x = 5;' with the semicolon\n- When adding function calls like 'printf(\"hello\")', you MUST write it as 'printf(\"hello\");' with the semicolon\n- If you'd like to add the line '        print(x);' you must fully write that out, with all spaces AND the semicolon!\n- Missing semicolons will cause compilation errors and require immediate fixing\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nI have a function that has a bug and needs to be fixed, can you help?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n7. You should **only** be editing the main.py file. You can look at other files, but don't modify them.\n\n8. If the main.py file has tests in it, you should not edit them, but you can run main.py to see if the tests pass. If there is a test.py file, run test.py instead of main.py to see if the tests pass.\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /swe-bench__humanevalfix-python)\nbash-$\nTo begin addressing the issue, we need more details about the function that requires implementation.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please  instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\"instance_template\":\"We're currently attempting to solve the following problem:\\n\\n<pr_description>\\n{{problem_statement}}\\n</pr_description>\\n\\nISSUE:\\n{{issue}}\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. gcc, java, g++, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them.\\n\\nCRITICAL EDITING REMINDERS:\\n- ALWAYS include semicolons (;) when editing C, C++, Java, JavaScript files\\n- Check file extensions (.c, .cpp, .java, .js) to identify when semicolons are required\\n- Every statement that needs a semicolon MUST have one or the code will fail to compile\\n- Use correct edit command syntax: edit \\\"old_text\\\" \\\"new_text\\\" (NOT line numbers)\\n- DO NOT use \\\"edit 12:12\\\" or similar line number syntax - this will fail\\n- DO NOT add \\\"end_of_edit\\\" - the command completes automatically\\n- After each edit, verify the syntax is complete and correct\\n\\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\\n3. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\\n5. BEFORE editing any file, check its extension (.c, .cpp, .java, .js, etc.) and remember to include proper syntax like semicolons for those languages.\\n6.

Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\\n\\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\\n    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.\\n    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\\n    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\\n    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\\n    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\\n\\n\",\"multi_line_command_endings\":{},\"submit_command_end_name\":null,\"reset_commands\":[],\"execution_timeout\":30,\"install_timeout\":300,\"total_execution_timeout\":1800,\"max_consecutive_execution_timeouts\":3},\"history_processors\":[{\"n\":5,\"polling\":1,\"always_remove_output_for_tags\":[\"remove_output\"],\"always_keep_output_for_tags\":[\"keep_output\"],\"type\":\"last_n_observations\"}],\"model\":{\"name\":\"ollama/gemma3:27b\",\"per_instance_cost_limit\":0.0,\"total_cost_limit\":0.0,\"per_instance_call_limit\":25,\"temperature\":0.7,\"top_p\":1.0,\"api_base\":\"https://talent-pentagon--ollama-server-ollamaserver-serve.modal.run\",\"api_version\":null,\"api_key\":null,\"stop\":[],\"completion_kwargs\":{},\"convert_system_to_user\":false,\"retry\":{\"retries\":20,\"min_wait\":10.0,\"max_wait\":120.0},\"delay\":0.0,\"fallbacks\":[],\"choose_api_key_by_thread\":true,\"max_input_tokens\":0,\"max_output_tokens\":null},\"max_requeries\":3,\"action_sampler\":null,\"type\":\"default\"},\"problem_statement\":{\"path\":\"../../Benchmark/Tests/c/test001.md\",\"extra_fields\":{},\"type\":\"text_file\",\"id\":\"benchmark_run\"},\"output_dir\":\"/Users/lunita/School/TalentPentagon/FinalProject/JesusEnriqueDiazBernalRobinsonBours/Benchmark/runs/gemma3:27b__t-0.70__p-1.00__c-0.00___benchmark\",\"actions\":{\"open_pr\":false,\"pr_config\":{\"skip_if_commits_reference_issue\":true},\"apply_patch_locally\":false},\"env_var_path\":null}",
